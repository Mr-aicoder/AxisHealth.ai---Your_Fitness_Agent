Since you're training 1-2 times a week, we'll utilize a full-body approach each session.  Focus on proper form over weight. If your form breaks down, reduce the weight.\n\n**Key:**  Increase the weight by the smallest increment possible (e.g., 2.5kg plates, 1kg dumbbells) each week if you successfully complete all sets and reps with good form.  If you fail a set, maintain the same weight the following week.\n\n**Warm-up (5-10 minutes before each workout):**\n\n* Light cardio, like jogging or jumping jacks\n* Dynamic stretches, such as arm circles, leg swings, and torso twists\n\n**Cool-down (5-10 minutes after each workout):**\n\n* Static stretches, holding each for 20-30 seconds (e.g., hamstring stretch, quad stretch, chest stretch)\n\n**Workout A (Day 1):**\n\n* **Barbell Squat:** 3 sets of 6-8 reps (Increase weight by smallest increment from previous week)\n* **Romanian Deadlift (RDL):** 3 sets of 8-10 reps (Increase weight by smallest increment from previous week)\n* **Overhead Press (OHP):** 3 sets of 6-8 reps (Increase weight by smallest increment from previous week)\n* **Dumbbell Bench Press:** 3 sets of 8-10 reps (Increase weight by smallest increment from previous week)\n* **Pull-ups (or Lat Pulldowns):** 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (If using lat pulldowns, increase weight)\n* **Cable Woodchops (NEW):** 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side (Focus on controlled movement and core engagement)\n\n\n**Workout B (Day 2 - Optional, perform 2-3 days after Workout A):**\n\n* **Barbell Squat:** 3 sets of 6-8 reps (Increase weight by smallest increment from previous week)\n* **Romanian Deadlift (RDL):** 3 sets of 8-10 reps (Increase weight by smallest increment from previous week)\n* **Overhead Press (OHP):** 3 sets of 6-8 reps (Increase weight by smallest increment from previous week)\n* **Dumbbell Bench Press:** 3 sets of 8-10 reps (Increase weight by smallest increment from previous week)\n* **Inverted Rows (or Barbell Rows):** 3 sets of as many reps as possible (AMRAP) (If using barbell rows, increase weight)\n* **Plank:** 3 sets, holding for 30-60 seconds (Increase hold time by 5-10 seconds each week)\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Rest:** Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets.  Listen to your body and rest longer if needed.\n* **Nutrition:**  Support your workouts with a balanced diet appropriate for your goals.\n* **Progression:**  Focus on progressive overload by increasing the weight lifted each week. If you can't increase the weight, try increasing the reps or sets.\n* **Form:**  Prioritize proper form over lifting heavy.  Watch videos and, if possible, consult with a trainer to ensure you're using correct technique.\n* **Listen to your body:**  If you experience pain, stop the exercise and consult with a healthcare professional.\n* **Deload:** Every 4-6 weeks, consider a deload week where you reduce the weight and volume of your training to allow your body to recover.  This can help prevent plateaus and injuries.\n\n\nThis updated plan replaces your previous routine.  The introduction of Cable Woodchops adds a new challenge for your core and oblique muscles, while the focus on progressive overload on the main lifts will help you break through your plateau. Remember consistency is key, and even small increases in weight over time will lead to significant strength gains. Good luck!",
