# üöÄ Features

## Phase 1: User Onboarding and Health Metrics Analysis 
This is the foundational phase where the system establishes a new user's profile and 
provides an initial health baseline.

#### 1. Login and Profile Creation: 
The user starts by logging in or registering with a 
unique user_id on the main page (app.py). They are then directed to the 
get_started.py page where they provide personal information such as age, weight, 
and fitness goals. This data is used to create a structured profile based on the 
user_profile_structure.py schema and is saved to the user_db.json file. 
#### 2. Initial BMI Analysis: 
The user is then automatically directed to the 
bmi_analyzer.py page. The system calculates their BMI using the weight and 
height from their profile. It then uses an LLM to provide a brief, non-medical 
interpretation of their BMI and saves this to their profile, establishing a crucial 
health baseline.

## Phase 2: Core Plan Generation 
Once the user's profile and initial health metrics are established, this phase focuses on 
generating their personalized workout and nutrition plans. 
#### 1. Workout Plan Generation: 
On the bmi_analyzer.py page, the user can trigger the 
generation of a workout plan. The trainer_agent.py acts as an "expert personal 
trainer" and uses an LLM to create a detailed weekly workout plan based on the 
user's fitness goals, experience level, and available equipment. 
#### 2. Nutrition Plan Generation: 
Following the workout plan, the nutritionist_agent.py 
acts as a "dietitian & nutritionist". It uses the user's profile and the new workout 
plan to create a daily meal plan, including an estimated calorie target and 
macronutrient breakdown. Both of these plans are then saved to the user's profile.

## Phase 3: Adaptive Planning and Ongoing Engagement 
This final phase focuses on making the project a dynamic and long-term health 
companion. 
#### 1. Workout Tracking: 
The user can log their workout details, such as exercise name, 
weight, and reps, on the log_workout.py page. This data is appended to their 
workout_log in the database, allowing for progress tracking. 
#### 2. Adaptive Planning: 
A key feature is the analysis_agent.py, which is an "advanced 
feature" triggered by a button on the dashboard (my_dashboard.py). This agent's 
logic can detect a plateau in the user's progress and will automatically re-invoke 
the trainer_agent and nutritionist_agent with new instructions to generate a more 
challenging, updated plan. 
#### 3. AI Chatbot: 
The user can interact with the conversational 
"AI Fitness Architect" on the dashboard. This agent can use tools like the 
coach_agent.py for motivational support or search the web for external 
knowledge to provide up-to-date information, making the platform a dynamic and 
engaging companion for the user's fitness journey. 
#### 3. Meal Calculator: 
This agent helps in calculating the macro nutrients like Protein, Carbs, Fats and the overall calories in the meal.
The meal calculator works by taking a user's text description of a meal and using a generative AI model to estimate the nutritional content. It analyzes the text, identifies ingredients, estimates quantities, and calculates the approximate calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fat, presenting the results in a formatted table.
